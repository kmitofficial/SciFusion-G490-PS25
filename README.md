## ⚙️ Why Agentic Workflows?

SciFusion embraces the **agentic paradigm** to replicate the structure of collaborative research teams. Each AI agent is a domain-specialized entity responsible for a focused task within the research lifecycle.

### 🧠 Benefits

- 🎯 **Task Specialization** – Clear role separation (e.g., idea generation, coding, debugging)
- 🔁 **Feedback Loop** – Real-time integration of human expert feedback
- 📈 **Scalability** – Adaptable across scientific domains and use cases
- ⚡ **Efficiency** – Parallel agent operations to speed up workflows
