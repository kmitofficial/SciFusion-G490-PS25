## 🚀 How to use the early version, Dolphin?

### Installation

```
conda create -n dolphin python=3.11
conda activate dolphin

# Install PyPI requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Start Auto-Research using Dolphin

```shell
bash launch_dolphin.sh

# modify launch_dolphin.py line # line 189 if round > 0
# exp_base_file_list = [List your exp dir] 
```

- Note that you need to add api_key and specify the model and topic in `launch_dolphin.sh`. You can refer to the [doc](./docs/ollama_doc.md) if you want to use self-deployed model.
